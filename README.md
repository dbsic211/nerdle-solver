Assumptions (may be a bit different from the original game but does not affect much): 

- commutative answers are turned off
- standard order of operations applies
- leading zeros are not allowed in guesses and the final answer, but lone zero(es) may appear
- negative numbers are not allowed in guesses and the final answer (but it may appear in intermediate steps, e.g. 3-4+10=9 is ok)
